<p>Touring the cultural centers of Central and Eastern Europe

Paris and Rome are beautiful, but there's more to Europe than taking the elevator to the top of the Eiffel Tower and eating gelato at the Colosseum. Eastern Europe is home to castles, cathedrals, world-famous symphonies, modern art museums, and great beer, wine, and pastries. The cities of Berlin, Warsaw, Krakow, Prague, and Budapest are important cultural centers with citywide art and architecture dating back to the Renaissance. Charles Bridge in Prague has been standing since the 12th century, and Vienna’s city center is home to both Habsburg architecture and modern design. </p>

Buckingham Palace is her official London residence and one of the few working royal palaces still in existence. In the summer some 19 State Rooms are open to visitors, where paintings by the likes of Rembrandt, Rubens and Canaletto are on display. The changing of the guard is also must-see.</>
