<h3> North America - Biking the wine valleys of Northern California</h3>

<p>Almost half of the wineries in the United States are located in California, and many of those are in the valleys north of San Francisco. Wine tasting and winery tours are a drunkenly entertaining way to learn how grapes become wine, but the process involves more than crushing and fermenting grapes. One needs to see the agriculture that goes into America’s wine making, and touch the grapes on the vine, to really appreciate the drink. Work off that hangover by cycling along the winding roads of Napa and Sonoma. </p>
<h3>NORTH AMERICA – INDY 500</h3>
<p>motor racing in america“Gentlemen, start your engines” are the infamous words that ring in the ears at the start of the Indy 500 race in Indianapolis. Even those who are not motorsport fans will be amazed at this spectacle of man and machine. Hundreds of thousands of spectators fill the stadiums, watching in awe as dozens of cars go flying around the concrete oval. Camp alongside the US fans and really soak up the atmosphere for a few days.</p>
